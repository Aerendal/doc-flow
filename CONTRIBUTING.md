# Contributing
Thank you for your interest in this project.

This repository is maintained without SLA and without guaranteed support.
Pull requests are welcome, but review and acceptance are not guaranteed.

When proposing a change:
- describe the problem and reproduction steps,
- include a minimal fixture/test when possible,
- keep CLI behavior aligned with `docs/CONTRACT.md`.
